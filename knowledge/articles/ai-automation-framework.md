## Overview

A comprehensive 6-step framework for building AI automations without writing any code. The author successfully used this framework to create a trading bot with 411 wins, a morning briefing system, and 3 other automations.

## The 6-Step Framework

### Step 1: Build the Dumbest Version
- I want to automate [describe the task]
- Build the dumbest version that works
- No libraries, no frameworks
- Focus on making it run

### Step 2: Fix and Learn
- Here's what went wrong: [paste the error or bad output]
- Fix the issues
- Explain what caused problems to learn from mistakes

### Step 3: Add Self-Checking
- After every run, audit the output
- If something looks off, log it
- Automatically suggest fixes
- Build in quality control

### Step 4: Optimize Costs
- Use expensive models only for decisions
- Use cheap models for monitoring
- Use free logic for execution
- Balance performance with cost

### Step 5: Full Logging
- Log every run
- Log every result
- Log every failure
- Create a complete audit trail for troubleshooting

### Step 6: Schedule and Automate
- Set up to run automatically
- Choose frequency: [every 15 min / every morning / on trigger]
- Make it autonomous
- Remove human intervention

## Real-World Applications

The author successfully implemented this framework to create:
1. **Trading Bot** - 411 wins
2. **Morning Briefing System**
3. **3 Additional Automations**

**Total code written: 0 lines**

## Key Insights

> "the skill isn't coding. it's knowing what to delegate."

The framework emphasizes:
- Prompt engineering as the core skill
- Iterative improvement through failure
- Cost optimization across different AI models
- Autonomous operation without manual intervention

## Implementation Tips

1. Start with simple automations
2. Embrace failure as part of the learning process
3. Focus on delegation rather than coding
4. Build comprehensive logging from day one
5. Schedule strategically based on your needs
