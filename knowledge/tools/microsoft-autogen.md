AutoGen is a programming framework for agentic AI that enables developers to create multi-agent AI applications capable of acting autonomously or working alongside humans. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem for building, testing, and deploying AI agents with sophisticated coordination and collaboration capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Create complex multi-agent workflows with specialized agents working together on tasks
- **Layered Architecture** - Three-tier design with Core API for message passing, AgentChat API for rapid prototyping, and Extensions API for integrations
- **Cross-Language Support** - Built for both Python and .NET developers
- **No-Code Studio** - AutoGen Studio provides a GUI for building multi-agent applications without writing code
- **Extensive Model Support** - Works with OpenAI, AzureOpenAI, and other popular LLM providers
- **Distributed Runtime** - Supports both local and distributed execution for scalability
- **Built-in Benchmarks** - AutoGen Bench provides tools for evaluating agent performance

## Use Cases

AutoGen is ideal for:
- Building complex AI applications that require specialized expertise
- Creating chatbots with multiple specialized agents (math experts, code reviewers, etc.)
- Developing autonomous research assistants that can browse the web and execute code
- Building AI-powered workflow automation systems
- Creating collaborative AI teams that can handle diverse tasks simultaneously
- Developing testbeds for evaluating multi-agent system performance
- Creating domain-specific AI applications with expert knowledge integration
