Markwhen is a keyboard-first timeline and planning tool that emphasizes text-based input over drag-and-drop interfaces. It's particularly well-suited for people who prefer keyboard navigation and want to avoid visual/mouse-driven UI paradigms.

The tool appears to be complementary to life-planning and retrospective exercises, useful for mapping out timelines, milestones, and planning future roadmaps. It supports flexible categorization and allows you to publish timelines publicly or keep them private.

## Key Features

- Keyboard-driven interface for timeline creation
- Text-based input model (no drag-and-drop required)
- Flexible timeline categorization
- Public or private timeline sharing
- Real-time preview

## Use Cases

- Annual reviews and planning
- Life retrospectives (mapping first half and projecting second half)
