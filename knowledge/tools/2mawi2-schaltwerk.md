Native terminal AI agents with git worktree isolation. A flexible, keyboard-first UI framework for React and Vue applications built entirely in Rust.

## Key Features
- Native terminal integration - runs agentic coding CLIs directly without wrappers
- Efficient multi-agent coordination with instant session switching (⌘1-9)
- Advanced agent orchestration with MCP server support
- Spec-driven development with markdown specs as reusable backlog
- Full control & privacy with GitHub-style diff reviews
- Session management with isolated git worktrees
- Dual terminals (agent terminal + testing shell)
- Automatic worktree creation per session
- Squash-merge to main with one command
- Custom environment variables per agent
- Support for multiple CLIs (GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini, Qwen, Factory Droid, Amp)

## Use Cases
Perfect for teams working on parallel development workflows, managing multiple AI coding agents simultaneously, maintaining isolation between experimental features, and implementing spec-driven development patterns. Ideal for developers who want to coordinate multiple AI assistants while keeping work isolated in separate git worktrees.
