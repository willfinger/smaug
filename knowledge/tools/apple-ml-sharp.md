SHARP is Apple's research project for photorealistic monocular view synthesis that turns a single photo into a 3D scene in less than one second. This AI-powered technology creates high-quality 3D Gaussian representations that can be rendered in real-time with metric camera movements. The software project accompanies the research paper "Sharp Monocular View Synthesis in Less Than a Second" by Apple researchers.

## Key Features

- **Ultra-fast 3D Synthesis**: Creates 3D representations from single images in less than one second via a single feedforward pass through a neural network
- **Real-time Rendering**: Produces high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views with 3D Gaussian splatting
- **Zero-shot Generalization**: Delivers robust generalization across different datasets without fine-tuning
- **State-of-the-art Performance**: Reduces LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43% versus prior models
- **Metric 3D Representations**: Supports absolute scale and metric camera movements for real-world applications
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface for prediction and rendering video trajectories
- **Open Source**: Fully open source with model checkpoints available for download
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Generates 3DGS .ply files compatible with various public 3DGS renderers

## Use Cases

- Creating 3D content from photos for games and virtual reality applications
- Photorealistic scene reconstruction for architectural visualization and modeling
- Fast prototyping of 3D scenes from reference images for creative workflows
- Metric 3D asset generation for AR/VR applications requiring accurate scale
- Academic research in computer vision, 3D reconstruction, and neural rendering
- Developing real-time rendering applications for immersive experiences
- Building AI-powered content creation tools for 3D graphics and media
- Researching state-of-the-art view synthesis and 3D generation techniques
