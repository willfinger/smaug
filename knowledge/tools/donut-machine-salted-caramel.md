Salted Caramel - A wrapper for OpenAI's GPT models that provides session management, caching, rate limiting, and fallback mechanisms.

## Key Features
- Session Management: Automatically manages OpenAI API sessions
- Caching: Built-in caching to reduce API calls and costs
- Rate Limiting: Configurable rate limiting to prevent API exhaustion
- Fallback Mechanisms: Multiple fallback options for reliability
- Cost Optimization: Reduces unnecessary API calls through intelligent caching
- Production Ready: Designed for robust production deployments

## Use Cases
- Applications requiring reliable OpenAI API access with session persistence
- Cost-sensitive projects that need to minimize API call expenses
- Systems requiring protection against rate limiting and API exhaustion
- Production services needing failover mechanisms and caching
- AI applications requiring session continuity across multiple requests
