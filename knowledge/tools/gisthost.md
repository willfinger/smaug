A fork and modernized version of gistpreview.github.io that enables browser-rendering of HTML files stored in GitHub Gists. Simon Willison updated the original project (last commit 10 years ago) with modern web practices and improved CSS.

The tool works by fetching GitHub Gist content via the GitHub API and rendering it as HTML in the browser, bypassing GitHub's content-type headers that normally serve Gist files as plain text.

## Key Features

- Render HTML files from GitHub Gists in the browser
- Modern CSS and improved UX over the original gistpreview
- Direct link format: `https://gisthost.github.io/?{GIST_ID}/{filename}`
- Works with any HTML file stored in a Gist

## Use Cases

- Quick HTML/CSS/JS prototyping and sharing
- Portfolio demonstrations
- Interactive documentation
- Teaching HTML/CSS concepts
