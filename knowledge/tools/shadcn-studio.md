Shadcn Studio is an open-source collection of copy-and-paste shadcn/ui components, blocks, and templates paired with a powerful theme generator. It extends the core shadcn/ui offering with more diverse component variants, pre-built blocks, and complete templates for faster UI development.

Unlike traditional npm-installable libraries, shadcn/studio follows the "copy-and-paste" philosophy of shadcn/ui, allowing developers to own and customize all code directly in their projects without library dependencies.
