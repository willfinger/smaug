The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. It provides a unified framework for connecting AI agents with various services, APIs, and data stores, allowing developers to build more powerful and context-aware applications.

## Key Features

- **Standardized Integration** - Universal protocol for connecting LLMs with external data sources
- **Data Provider Registry** - Built-in registry for discovering and connecting to data sources
- **Streaming Support** - Real-time data streaming for dynamic context updates
- **Authentication & Security** - Built-in support for secure API connections and authentication
- **Protocol Extensions** - Extensible design for custom data source implementations
- **Reference Implementations** - Collection of ready-to-use server implementations for common data sources
- **Multi-Language Support** - Designed to work across different programming languages and platforms

## Use Cases

- **Enhanced AI Applications** - Connect LLMs with your company's internal documents, databases, and APIs
- **Knowledge Integration** - Provide AI agents with access to domain-specific knowledge bases
- **Workflow Automation** - Create context-aware workflows that leverage both AI and external systems
- **Data Pipeline Enhancement** - Bridge the gap between AI processing and existing data infrastructure
- **API Integration** - Connect LLMs to thousands of existing APIs and services
