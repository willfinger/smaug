Databricks MLOps Stacks is a customizable framework that provides production-ready machine learning operations (MLOps) best practices out of the box. Developed by Databricks, this stack enables data scientists and machine learning engineers to quickly set up and deploy ML projects while giving ops engineers the tools needed to configure CI/CD pipelines and ML service infrastructure efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Production-Ready Templates** - Pre-configured templates following MLOps best practices
- **Databricks Asset Bundles** - End-to-end project definition using YAML-based configuration
- **CI/CD Integration** - Built-in support for continuous integration and deployment
- **Multi-Cloud Support** - Works with both AWS Databricks and Azure Databricks
- **Customizable Architecture** - Flexible configuration for different project needs
- **ML Workflow Orchestration** - Complete ML pipeline definition from training to deployment
- **Environment Management** - Consistent environments across development, staging, and production
- **Monitoring and Observability** - Integrated monitoring for ML models and infrastructure

## Use Cases

- **Rapid ML Project Setup** - Start new ML projects with production-grade infrastructure
- **MLOps Standardization** - Implement consistent MLOps practices across teams
- **Enterprise ML Deployment** - Deploy and manage ML models at scale
- **CI/CD for ML** - Automate the ML deployment lifecycle
- **Multi-Environment Management** - Manage development, staging, and production environments
- **Team Collaboration** - Enable collaboration between data scientists and ops teams
- **Model Lifecycle Management** - Track and manage models from training to retirement
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Define ML infrastructure using declarative configuration
