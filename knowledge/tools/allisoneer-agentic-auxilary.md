- ClaudeCode-RS: Rust SDK for programmatically interacting with Claude Code CLI
- opencode_rs: Rust SDK for OpenCode with HTTP endpoints and SSE streaming
- claude_to_opencode_migration: Python script to migrate Claude Code configuration to OpenCode
- GPT-5 Reasoner: Two-phase prompt optimization tool (optimize with Claude, execute with GPT-5)
- Anthropic Async: Production-ready asynchronous client for Anthropic's API with prompt caching

## Use Cases
Perfect for AI developers who need to organize code across multiple repositories, build reusable tool frameworks, migrate between AI coding assistants, optimize prompts using multiple models, and create production-ready async clients for Anthropic's API.
