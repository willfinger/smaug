Rehook is a React hooks management platform and component creation tool that serves as a marketplace for developers to share, discover, and utilize custom React hooks. Created by Ala Eddine Menai, Rehook simplifies React development by providing a centralized registry of pre-built hooks and an alternative approach to component creation using native HTML and CSS rather than traditional JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Key Features

- **Hook Marketplace** - Centralized registry where developers can browse, copy, and paste custom React hooks
- **Visual Component Builder** - Create React components using native HTML and CSS instead of JavaScript
- **Alternative to CSS-in-JS** - Native CSS approach for styling React components
- **Community-Driven** - Platform for developers to publish and share their custom hooks
- **Easy Integration** - Simple copy-paste workflow for adding hooks to projects
- **Documentation Support** - Comprehensive documentation with multi-language support
- **Active Development** - Regularly updated with new hooks and features

## Use Cases

- **Rapid Prototyping** - Quickly implement common functionality with pre-built hooks
- **Code Reusability** - Share hooks across projects and team members
- **Learning Resources** - Browse and study community-created React hooks
- **UI Development** - Create components using familiar HTML/CSS syntax
- **Team Collaboration** - Standardize hook usage across development teams
- **Performance Optimization** - Use battle-tested hooks instead of custom implementations
- **Documentation Generation** - Create visual documentation with live examples
