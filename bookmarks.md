> TinyClaw is 99.3% smaller than OpenClaw 🦞 with the same features and even more

It’s so simple and minimal that you can understand the entire codebase during your lunch break

It's fast and stable, you can deploy it to any cloud sandbox with just a one-liner

It’s powerful and composable, you can build teams of agents that collaborate with each other

It’s tiny 🤏 but mighty 💪

I used it to build my web app video game builder

Overall what I am doing is:
1. Plan out what I am going to do, just like talking to a seasoned product owner/manager/you name it with the plan mode (ask mode in Cursor)

2. Brainstorm with AI on how to approach things, up to the granular level, defining the edge cases, etc.

3. Keep circling back to AI to update the md file for the whole context

> This update changed EVERYTHING

Polymarket finally added 5-min crypto charts

But most traders have NO IDEA what it really means

Spoiler: vibe coders will make MILLIONS and retire

Here's why:

These new markets aren’t long-term bets.
They’re binary.

> $BTC up or down in the next 5 minutes.
> $ETH up or down in 5 minutes.

Resolved automatically via Chainlink.

Every. Five. Minutes.

This turns Polymarket from an event platform into a volatility engine.

Manual traders? 
Probably cooked.

> Elon Musk thinks coding dies this year.

Not evolves. Dies.

By December, AI won’t need programming languages. It generates machine code directly. Binary optimized beyond anything human logic could produce. No translation. No compilation. Just pure execution.

Musk: “You don’t even bother doing coding.”

Code was never the point. It was friction. A tax we paid because machines didn’t speak human. AI just learned fluent human. The tax is gone.

Now plug that into Neuralink. No syntax. No keyboard

> Sub agents and agent modes are crap. This is getting so dumb. I asked claude to implement a feature, so first it switches to plan mode, then it calls the explore agent, then it does some more random thinking and calls, then it calls the plan agent to create a plan. This is AI theater, none of this helped and so many calls were duplicated. This could have just been one linear thread. And then it by default want to "clear context." You know what the first thing it does after you clear the context!

In our recent 4-day sprint for Backhouse, they needed to stand out in a sea of polished, sterile production house sites.

The brief that the founders brought to us was making the experience feel analog, but contemporary. Disruptive, but intentional.

So we leaned into texture and the analog vibe.

> Finally found a way to pay for my Claude subscription.

Told my clawdbot to build me a Polymarket trading bot for 15-minute crypto markets.

Gave it $100 and let it learn all day while I worked.

Results: It lost $20 learning and iterating, but now it's at 92% win rate and ended up making $21 today.

If it keeps this up, it'll be at $1K/month passive income.

A high salary is never 9-5.

It's 9-7/8 + weekends. It's having strached OKRs that need to be met. It's C-level managers who need that quarterly plan ready an hour ago, and endless meetings.

But yes, high salary and disconnecting at 5 is great.

In my experience the hard thing isn't knowing ... it's having the courage to do something about it.

But by not doing something about it, you are either going to look weak or stupid.   

Stupid, because you can't see what's happening.   

Or weak, because you do see it, but are too fearful to do anything about it.

Not the choice you want to have to make.

> I keep seeing this really stupid post: “I tried ClawdBot and there are NO good use cases”

Let’s put this to rest

Then 7 most life changing ClawdBot use cases I’ve implemented (so far):

• Overnight coder. Every night Clawd builds 1 app using Claude Code that it thinks will improve your workflow based on your conversations

• Based on every conversation you’ve ever had with your Clawd, get a daily research report explaining 1 relevant topic spoken in the voice of a professor

• Headless Notion.

> Every night ClawdBot builds me out new apps and ships more code without me asking

People keep saying there's no way it's doing it proactively

It does, because I set the expectations it should

Feed this prompt to your ClawdBot to get it to work more proactively:

"I am a 1 man business. I work from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. I need an employee taking as much off my plate and being as proactive as possible. Please take everything you know about me and just do work you thi

> This is getting scary. I'm doing some research this morning when all of a sudden my computer starts speaking to me

I look to my left and my ClawdBot Henry all of a sudden has a voice

He coded himself a voice using the ChatGPT API. Without me asking.

Now whenever he finishes long coding/research tasks he alerts me through voice

So to recap:
• 2 nights ago he built himself a body
• Last night he built himself a voice (altho it's a female voice for a male assistant. We'll have to work on that)

> Holy crap. qmd by @tobi saved me 96% on tokens with clawdbot. Here's how:

I have an Obsidian vault with 600+ notes. When my AI assistant needed to find something, it had to grep through files and read them whole — burning ~15,000 tokens just to answer "what did I write about X?"

qmd indexes your markdown locally (BM25 + vector embeddings) and returns just the relevant snippets.

Same query: 500 tokens.

Setup took 5 minutes:

Also Clawdbot tip, if you’re using telegram, you just need to use a Google API or an OpenAI API to index all the chats so that when it packs the context every 200,000 tokens, it can remember the whole conversation. Make sure to have it update https://t.co/30Kq3JE4RX it was so annoying to have it forget the conversation and then forcing it to re-go through the chat.

Also switch 4.5 Opus to 4.5 sonnet, it can do the agentic tasks just as good and it’s 5x Cheaper per token and 2-3x

> The bottleneck isn’t Figma, it’s the handoff.
Static specs force engineers to wait for “perfect” designs.

The fix: shift from final specs to executable intent early.
Design defines behavior + states, engineers build directly from it, and details get resolved in code instead of in endless Figma frames.

> An easy way to stand out in any business is to be old school in how you approach your work:

- Respond to emails quickly
- Follow up when you say you will
- Write like a human with emotions
- Show up on time (10 minutes early is on time)
- Remember names
- Remember birthdays
- Remember if they have kids 
- Write handwritten thank you notes
- Send holiday cards with family updates

The bar is low. Especially in a world with AI.

the biggest shift for me was realizing: a case study isn’t a museum of artifacts, it’s a story designed for someone to walk away with a very specific impression of you.

so before you even touch figma screenshots or layouts, decide two things:

- who is this for?
- what’s the one sentence you want them to remember?

maybe your audience is a startup founder who cares about

open the site in your browser, log in normally

open dev tools → network tab → refresh

find the first request that loads the content you want

right click → copy as curl

this copies your auth cookies with it. paste that curl in terminal and you'll get the same content outside the browser

now just give claude code that curl command and tell it to fetch from that endpoint. it'll handle the rest

1. use plan mode (shift + tab)
2. write “ultrathink” in your prompts to make claude smarter
3. be selective with ultrathink, it slows you down and fills the context window
4. use “/“ and explore all the slash commands
5. hit “esc” twice to undo code or restore conversation from a different point
6. after claude writes code simply ask it “run dev” to see what it made locally
7. type “/init” to create project instructions
8. us

So I built a Mac app with Manus: Typewriter.

Record with Screen Studio and you get:

→ nonstop on-screen typing  
→ basically no tedious post work

> Here is an incredibly useful prompt to use with Claude Code and Opus 4.5 to improve the UI/UX of your web application. 

I use this mostly for NextJS 16 apps with React 19, Tailwind 4, and other libraries like Framer Motion, but it's pretty generic and should work with anything. 

Something about the phrasing, and asking for agreement from the model, somehow motivates it to polish things up better. Also, instructing it to separately think through desktop vs mobile leads to much better outcomes.

> Every day people ask how I created a custom UI for Claude code and it's really....just this. 😅

My custom chat sends my requests over a secure little bridge to a server with cc installed. 

Claude responds and includes the session ID in the response. 

My system streams the content of the response back to the custom client along with the session ID. 

Next time I post a turn, I includes the session ID so instead of starting an empty session, it picks up where the last turn left off.

> Every vibe-coded app looks the same

Here's how to fix yours so it stands out:

Step 1: Add micro-animations to page transitions 
Step 2: Add haptic feedback on every tap 
Step 3: Add subtle bounces to modals/sheets 
Step 4: Add motion to loading states

Tools: Claude Code (trained on Apple's animation library) 

Cost: $0 extra 

Time: 6 hours → app that "just feels different"

THE KEY: Details compound

Same app. Same code. 6 hours apart. 

One got 7 likes. One got 800 waitlist signups.

> The Codex  "/review" command uses this prompt:
https://t.co/9PXyUoqTiq

It's quite opinionated, so instead you can ask you main agent to spawn a sub agent:

codex exec \
  -s read-only \
  -m gpt-5.2-codex \
  -c model_reasoning_effort="xhigh" \ 
  "<review-prompt>"

This works for any use case as a Codex sub agent, and can tweak the model, config, permissions etc

If it's a Skill you'd like to see, let me know and I'll create one!

> Most new designers focus only on how the screen looks.

Developers struggle because of what’s missing:
• No spacing rules
• No typography scale
• No color tokens
• No component logic
• No states documented

That’s where development slows and breaks.

Our every project ships with a design system, so the development becomes faster, cleaner, and predictable.

Good design isn’t just visual.
It shows up in the build.

The best builders chase principles.

@FoundersPodcast conversation with @patrick_oshag completely reframed how to think about success, work, and a meaningful life.

Here are the ideas I cannot stop thinking about:

1/ The most exciting thing in the world is finding talent before it is obvious. Learning before others do. Being at the frontier of people, not just ideas.

> Here's an example of how a small change of incorporating brand tints can change the whole feeling of the UI.

On the left, we have basic black tints with some brand color splashed in, leaving it feeling a little too much like a UI Kit.

On the right, we've used blue tints on all the core elements to build a subtle brand feeling that's unique and intentional.

It's even more vital when designing trading interfaces where you have to contend with very prominent red/green price indicators.

Call it passion at 60 hours, quiet quitting at 40 - and wonder why 82% of designers are burned out.

Design has a problem other tech roles don't.

Our work is never done. There's always one more iteration, one more pixel to perfect.

Good enough feels like failure.

24% of designers report high burnout - highest in tech (by @lennysan). Not because we work harder, but because creativity can't be timeboxed.

Remote work was supposed to help. Instead it erased the boundari

We built an interviewer that achieves peer status, so experts reveal the judgment patterns they'd only share with a colleague.

I wrote a blog about how we architected the multi-agent system behind this, how we extract expert thinking, and build digital personas that feel like talking to a peer.

> 🚨STILL USING LOGITECH G HUB?🚨
🛑 STOP. It eats unnecessary CPU & background resources 24/7.
✅ Instead, use Logitech Onboard Memory Manager
It lets you:
• Saves DPI, polling rate, and button remaps directly to the device
• Once saved, you can close the software completely
• Cuts out ALL background usage for cleaner performance
⚠️ Note: Onboard Manager does NOT support macros, only GHUB does

> My biggest takeaways from @stewart:

1. Product design is about creating understanding, not removing friction. Teams obsess over reducing friction and removing steps, but 70% to 80% of product design challenges are actually about helping people *understand* what your product does and what to do next. Users arrive barely interested and confused about what you offer. If they can’t quickly grasp what they’re looking at, they’ll leave. Making confusing things faster just gets users to the exit quick

⟶ AI agent writes the code
⟶ @coderabbitai reviews the changes
⟶ AI implements the review suggestions
⟶ AI returns the code to me

This results in less bugs and better code reviews. You should try this approach.

They start with 10-page PRDs that nobody reads. Then wonder why engineers ignore them.

Elite PMs do it differently. They use three document types, each with a specific purpose.

Start with 1-pagers. They're decision documents, not specifications.

Your goal: Get stakeholders to say yes or no.

Steve is an open-source Minecraft mod that brings LLM-powered AI agents (Groq, OpenAI, Gemini) directly into the game. Instead of helping you write code, these agents play alongside you - mining, building, exploring, and fighting through natural language commands.

You type things like “mine some iron” or “build a house”, and the agent understands the context, plans a sequence of actions, and executes them autonomously.

and they TEST THEIR OWN CODE in a native browser

while coding bootcamps are charging $15K to teach you react, cursor's teaching AI to:

→ write code 4x faster than gpt-5
→ run 8 versions simultaneously to pick the best one
→ test in chrome devtools without leaving the IDE
→ iterate on

> XBOW raised $117M to build AI hacking agents.

Now someone just open-sourced it for FREE.

Strix deploys autonomous AI agents that act like real hackers - they run your code dynamically, find vulnerabilities, and validate them through actual proof-of-concepts.

Why it matters:

The biggest problem with traditional security testing is that it doesn't keep up with development speed.

Strix solves this by integrating directly into your workflow:

↳ Run it in CI/CD to catch vulnerabilities before pr

> Shipped a couple improvements to my simple open source system for keeping your AI dev on track:

https://t.co/9DTRRZL1h3

One of the biggest changes was removing the 3rd file which closely controlled the agent. 

The models have gotten a *lot* better since I released this and there's no longer a need to hand hold the agent one task at a time (remember those days though?)

The repo is up to 6,700 stars now - bonkers. Thanks for all your support y'all.

I list all my installed tools (vercel, supabase, gh, etc.) in CLAUDE .md and let Claude use them to check logs, run queries, or tweak configs.

Setup is simpler, auth is native, and observability is crystal clear.

There’s still debate on CLI vs MCP, but in my workflow, CLI is miles ahead

(the original post is quoted below).

One of the most frequent questions readers asked was: “Isn’t it possible to create a fanout graph in LangGraph that performs parallel guideline matching, like Parlant does?”

Yes, but it misses the point. While you can create any type of execution model with a generic graph, it doesn’t actually help you implement the complexities of what a good guideline-matching graph actually does.

Guideline matching goes far be

follow these steps:

1. install steve yegge's beads cli

> 🙅‍♂️ Stop repeating yourself in form fields

Before you include placeholder text inside input fields, ask yourself if it's needed. The answer is generally, no. Here's why:

❌ Including instructions like “Type your email” in placeholder text is redundant, as people generally know that input fields need to be filled out.

❌ Placeholder text can also make the field look like it's already been filled, so some might mistakenly skip the field.

Do you still include placeholder text as well as a label

> I just trained a custom GPT that turns any idea into a Nano Banana JSON prompt

just describe the picture you want and it will:

– plan the photo like a creative director
– offer pro-level suggestions
– write the entire JSON prompt for you

all you have to do is copy and paste the JSON and you'll get images that look like a creative director made it

comment "nano" and I'll DM it to you (must be following)

> Hundreds of people asked me recently how to grow on X

The path is extremely simple:

0-500: be a reply guy, leave 50 comments a day and engage more than you post

500-3000: do giveaways/lead magnets. It's either product, service, or information

3000-10000: download @TweetHunterIO, analyze the most viral posts of people in your niche, then replicate them

10000+: just expiriment with the content, below 10k followers you're big enough for your content to go viral but not big enough for people to

⚠️I'm down 40% on my $S (entry ~$0.57). Unlike Andre, I'm lazy. But I do have a recovery plan

→ My bag is at $60k from $100k (hypothetical)

Assuming worse case

Using simple S/USDC LP, this is how long it'd take me to breakeven:

✯ 200% APR for my range on either Shadow or Metro (better APR but lower liquidity)

✯ No compounding, but rebalancing as needed

✯ Low IL as Sonic has been moving in the same range. Even if it breaks out, IL = minimum if monit

Currently building (and testing) a workflow for apparel brands using @Weavy_ai.

Started by taking 3 samples to create a seed image:
1—clothes
2—person
3—location

From there, created 20 new angles/shots from the same scene.

→ Put that into a showcase grid.
→ Used a start and end frame to create a video clip.
→ Took 3 shots from the 20, to create 360° views for 3 specific target areas (head, full body, pants).

It can be applied to any logo and is built natively in Framer. I’ve listed it for free on the Framer Component Marketplace, it’s currently under review and hope it gets approved soon. but you can try it, so go try it out, try ur own logo, and share your versions in the comments. Can’t wait to see y'all versions, thank you! ❤️

> It’s financially foolish to purchase a $5M+ home if you can rent…

1. Due to interest rates of jumbo mortgages and loss of tax benefits for mortgages over $750k, you have to pay a much higher down payment (sometimes 95% down). So that’s $4M down payment for a $5M house

2. Property taxes are extremely high for these homes (roughly 1%), so that’s $50k in property taxes on a $5M house 

At 8% returns, $4M could earn you $320k per year if invested 

So $320k + $50k =$370k. Which is $30,833 per mont

> The math only works because of today's interest rates.

Even after inflation adjustments and home renovations and repairs I've made over $300K on my place in 20 years. 

When I sell the house in another 15 or so years it will likely be worth about $2M.

Compare that to 35 years of renting where the rent started at $3,000 a month and has gone up with a very modest inflation value of 3% a year.

That sums to $2M paid in rent.

At the end of the 35 years of renting the renter owns nothing whereas I

> Nano Banana + Runway Act 2 = full creative flexibility  

Image generation might feel “solved” - but Nano Banana shows we’re only just scratching the surface.  
It’s insanely fast (sub-5s per render), cheap, and gives you realism + flexibility to turn any image into *exactly what you want*.  

Here’s how I tested it 👇

> Timelapse video of a stadium rising!

Prompt : Timelapse video from a fixed camera on a neighborhood rooftop, the city’s skyline hazy beyond.

- Auto-posts to TikTok/YouTube

Now days, every designer seems to have a “studio” and charges $5K a month per client.

$5K!!!!??

Y’all. My friends and I were charging $7K-$10K a WEEK consistently, as freelancers working like agencies (2-3 projects at once).

If you’ve never worked at a real agency you wouldn’t know, but designers work on 2-3 projects at once almost all the time there. Sometimes more. 

As an example, at one agency I worked on NFL + ESPN at the same time. At another

Every designer should copy this approach and keep a daily log of their design iterations. Doesn't have to be super structured but just date and name for each design iteration

Biggest benefit I see for using this approach is building trust with your design manager and stakeholders as they can go into your Figma file and visualize your progress/efforts

Also scares away micro managers😉

> This is actually why I started my first business. I got sick of getting no where with job apps. 10 years later I own 3 houses, working on a 4th, I travel nearly every month for fun mixed with business, buy what I want, my kids have what they need and then some and I have more free time than my wagie friends. And I'm in better shape than ever.

After trying them all, I prefer TaskMaster AI.
The MCP works great with Cursor, but you can also use the CLI directly.

asked him the main lesson he learnt from 5 years building: 

- Pick/build a product with built in distribution or you have a novel insight on how to distribute  

It’s easier to iterate a product towards high retention vs iterating towards high distribution (you have less control, it’s higher up the funnel)

Distribution remains king

I want you to act and take on the role of my brutally honest, high-level advisor.

Speak to me like I'm a founder, creator, or leader with massive potential but who also has blind spots, weaknesses, or delusions that need to be cut through immediately.

I don't want comfort. I don't want fluff. I want truth that stings, if that's what it takes to grow.
Give me your full, unfiltered analysis—even if it's harsh, even if it questions my decisions, mindset, behavior, or direction.

This implements Anthropic's "think tool" (from their recent engineering blog) as an MCP server for Cursor. The think tool gives Claude a dedicated space for structured reasoning, which improves performance by 54% on complex tasks according to Anthropic's research.

What it does for Cursor:
- Makes Claude follow complex instructions more accurately
- Reduces errors in multi-step code tasks
- Improves analysis

I call it "Pilot" mode

- Use "Ask" to request a feature or report a bug.
- Then click "Apply" to update your files.

This method is faster because Cursor doesn’t need to apply diffs against the code. Plus, if you include the project tree, you’ll get even quicker results.

And many vibe coders not aware of it:

1. Have Claude 3.7 to design whole UI screen by screen
2. Ask it to make a plan, break down into components
3. Turn into actual project

By having Claude focus on just UI generation, it does a great job

You can build beautiful UI without shadcn

I use Cursor to write code 90% of the time. I built an MCP server to connect the Cursor agent to GroundX, an open-source RAG system, and I'm not going back. This is officially insane!

Here is what I did, step by step:

First, a little bit of context. I maintain an end-to-end Machine Learning System with several pipelines to process data, train, evaluate, register, deploy,

in edit mode, select all, hit m and merge by distance, exit edit mode, add decimate modifier, get that baby down to less than 1k triangles. 

resize texture to 512 should be plenty for arms. 

using blender 4.1+ you can export textures as webp format. alternatively you can use ktx compression but it’s harder. 

should be able to get that down to 30-40kb or less

(model context protocol)

TLDR: MCP makes it possible for AI Tools to use external tools. E.g. Chatbot/IDE/AI-Agent can use Gmail/GoogleDrive/WeatherApp etc.

Detailed explanation for both, tech & non tech people (+demos):

1) AI Tools (chatbots, wrappers, agents, code generator, etc) wanna talk to external systems.

In pre-MCP world, one would have to write code to connect AI tool to the external system via API. Which meant every connection had to be p

> ok MCPs with Cursor blew my mind and they're all over my feed, here's why you should care:

Basically an MCP is like a plugin that translates apps to an LLM, so an agent can talk to those apps and services.

Think of it like giving your AI agent the ability to see and act inside those apps like, Supabase, Github, Linear, Figma etc.. It can go grab real-time data, take actions, control these apps. All those workflows possible by just chatting with your agent.

So your LLM doesn't wait for you to

MCP stands for "Model Context Protocol." It's an open standard for connecting AI with data. Instead of worrying about 10,000 different ways to do the same thing, MCP provides a standard approach.

• To expose your data to AI → Use an MCP server
• To access data → Build an MCP client

However, the MCP specification is new, so there aren't many applications with MCP servers right now, and some of the ones you'll find a

Because of the way RGB colors are stored, straight interpolation will lead to dips in brightness. Motion instead mixes the square of the color, which avoids this dip. https://t.co/4A3ve4ZHAs

While other AI companies are just implementing basic MCP support, devs are already using  Cline to build their own custom MCP servers from scratch -- because Cline understands MCP innately.

> Old Process vs New Process for Landing Page Design:

Old Process:

- Finalize the copy.
- Design the entire landing page.
- Send the full design to the client.
- Risk of misalignment after hours of work.

New Process:

- Finalize the copy.
- Create multiple Hero Section iterations.
- Let the client pick their favorite.
- Design the full landing page based on their choice.

Faster alignment. Fewer revisions. Happier clients.

Iterate your process, not just your designs.

We’re backed by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund & execs of frontier AI labs like OpenAI, Pika, & Cognition.

Icon (https://t.co/RKWomrKrAu) is like ChatGPT + CapCut, but for making winning ads with AI in minutes.

How it works:
1. Icon looks at your video library & tags scenes (e.g. "close-up," "unboxing"). These scenes become reusable clips used as lego blocks for making ads.
2. Prompt Icon’s AdGPT to generate scripts focused on specific angles & au

> @trikcode @CodeByPoonam Why not run it locally? If you have 17gb of vram, the 32b model fits. 14b should be practical for most.

There's a 0.5b that is almost usable and is under 600mb, runs on a 🥔. Look for QwQ.

> "Don't judge a book by its cover" doesn't apply to apps

If your product doesn’t look good, people won’t trust it

Users make snap judgments based on aesthetics

If the App Store images look beautiful, they'll download it

If the onboarding is delightful, they'll continue using it

Having a polished design is the bare minimum to even get a second glance

It reportedly works by destabilizing microtubules, the structures that help cancer cells divide and grow.

Rogan asked, “What did they take?”—to which Gibson hesitantly replied, “They took what you’ve heard they’ve taken.”

> Turn any GitHub repository into LLM-ready text!

Simply replace "hub" with "ingest" in a GitHub URL and receive a prompt-friendly text ingest for LLMs.

Gitingest is 100% open-source and provides:

- Directory structure
- A brief summary of the project
- The entire content as LLM-ready text

Plus, it comes with a nice python package and you can run the UI locally!

Stay tuned, I'm working on something really cool with this!✨

> HOW #ALTSEASON STARTED LAST CYCLE❓❓❓
#Btc broke all time high, went 100% above previous top.
Dominance went back then to 70% and then btc corrected 30% and altcoins 40%.
The moment that correction started that was the end of btc dominance rule.🧐🧐🧐
As btc bottomed after drop of 30% #alts started exploding.💥
In just 90 days altcoins across the board did 10x and more.
Alt season was 3 months and it was legendary.
Usually alt season is not more then 2 and a half month to 4 months.

Only thing I'd add is that you can also bridge into their own L2: https://t.co/4XcIKNiCx0

When you bridge in, you get the 'Early Bird' Achievement

It's ETH Mainnet-only, but Gwei is at 13 right now, so could be a good time window to bridge some ETH in

→ My focus is mainly on: https://t.co/1MtudDmy77

▫️ Swap Volume (2-3 txs a week)
▫️ Bridging in (which is through LayerZero)
▫️ LPing 

It remains to be seen if Pontem

1) Buy $stATOM with $ATOM on @osmosiszone 

2) Withdraw $stATOM to @stride_zone 

3) Unstake the $stATOM (wait 21-24 days)

4) Repeat 

This nets you ~35% APR, Vs ~19% for regular staking.

This has been working for a long time, and will continue to work while the Osmosis redemption rate is a couple of % away from the Protocol redemption rate.
